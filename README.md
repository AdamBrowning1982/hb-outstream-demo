# hb-outstream-demo
This is a demo project to assist publishers in implementing Video Header Bidding with OneVideo's Outstream Player/Renderer.

Before you test you must contact OneVideo/Video SSP for 2 reasons:
1. Create or activate your account for Header Bidding - you will receive a Publisher_ID to enter in the adUnit configuration (see index.html Line 48)

2. Whitelist your domains - Traffic from unlisted domains will be automatically rejected. Please contact OneVideo/Video SSP and provide us with your testing and production domains you whish to run Outstream Header Bidding on.
It is possible to temporarly override for testing - feel free to contact us for assistance at video.support@verizonmedia.com

Thanks in advance,
Adam
